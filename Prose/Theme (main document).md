*Everything must serve the theme.  This means plot, characters, graphics, sound, and even gameplay.*

The above is certainly true.  Games have a unique ability, as opposed to traditional media (books, movies, music, etc.) to make the consumer feel like they are a part of the media, since, actually, they *are*.  There is apparently a cost to this, though, since games must be *games*, and what you're doing often dominates what the game is trying to say.  So it's a trade-off.

The solution, insofar as it is possible, is to keep the theme well in mind at all times before, and when, designing or implementing any part of the game.  So what's the theme?

It's several points:

1. People have done wrong, and continue to do wrong.  This applies not only to the "obvious" cases (murderers, etc.) but even and *especially* to people who think they've never done anything wrong, or at least wrong enough to be worth mentioning.  To that case, a rephrasing: just because something is normal and common doesn't make it not wrong.
2. Justice comes eventually, and more importantly, it is not just a capricious negative event.  It is really and truly *deserved*.  And it is coming.
3. Because of God's great love for us, he has given us an out.  Specifically this is because of a somewhat complicated theological argument, where he took our punishment for us, then made us one with his body, so that justice was served to us without us having to feel it.  But the point is that because of (sacrificial) love and mercy, we escape justice.
4. We still face a choice of whether or not to accept this substitution.  If we refuse to accept (or try to escape the question), justice is still around the corner.
5. If we accept it, we are also bound to stop doing wrong.  This takes a million different forms, is often frightening subtle, and is incredibly hard to wrap your head around.  It still requires more divine intervention.  Regardless, we are still bound to stop doing wrong.

Okay, so this is basically a list of the core tenets of the Christian faith.  Fine.  But I think, as much as my generation gets nervous around mention of God, points 3-5 are not really the main stumbling block.  Really, people deny point 1, and therefore think point 2 is just God being mean-spirited and capricious (hypothetically speaking, since most folks, at least the ones I know, don't believe that God actually exists).  This feels so wrong that they're not interested in the rest.  They can't believe that a God like this would exist, so it all falls apart.

*Tangent (why this theme?):*  Society has adopted a "live-and-let-live" attitude which is almost a religion.  It is considered completely unacceptable behavior to tell someone they're doing wrong.  I think this actually came from a good place!  Perhaps it even has a biblical root:

> Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others,
> you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

> “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no
> attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let
> me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your
> own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you
> will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
>
> (Matthew 7:1-5, NIV)

Unfortunately, society seems to have stopped early in the passage.  They got the part where you need to clean your house up first, but they forgot the part where you do that, then you finish, then you help others clean themselves up.  But whatever the source, somewhere along the way, we ended up with "don't try to force your morals on others."

And that leads almost immediately to everybody thinking they're doing fine.  I mean, we're social creatures.  We define our whole experience around our interactions with people.  And if no one is hassling us, telling us we're doing wrong, then we assume we must not be doing anything wrong.

Surely someone would have mentioned it before now.

**Back to the original point:** Given all that, what I want to say with this game is that people, people who society thinks are good (or neutral, or not that bad, or kind of bad but justified) really do need to do better.  And they really do deserve justice.  I also really want to say all those other things: that through divine mercy we have a chance, and a billion chances, to accept salvation, that we can escape justice and do good and become more than we are.  But none of that makes any sense, unless we believe that we *are* doing wrong.

And that, more than anything else, is what this game is about.
