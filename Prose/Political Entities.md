The City (Jerusalem analogue)
> Historically it was the capital and heart of the Apiru, a small kingdom with a resilient culture.  Most people don't remember that time anymore.  More recently, it was an independent city-state which was seen as a holy place by its inhabitants, but who no longer respected the things that made it so.

> Young people don't even remember that. A few decades ago it was completely destroyed by the Baqilite Empire, and all its people sold into slavery.  Even that's in the past though; not long after its conquest, Roslim devoured Baqil, and reclassified the slaves as "indentured servants."  This gave a possible (if quite difficult) way for Apiru slaves to get their freedom, and more importantly, meant their children were born free (if very poor).

> This move was extended to several people groups within the now-defunct Baqilite empire intended to inspire loyalty to the state (since, in total, these small groups added up to a large minority of the Roslimi empire, and who could either be kept down by an expensive use force or added to the economy).  It was largely successful at this purpose, and the Apiru view Roslim as a rescuer.

> Less obviously successful was the Roslimi effort of resettling these people (under close supervision) in their ancestral homes.  While people were eager to reestablish themselves, they were not consistently eager to hand the newly established cities over to Roslim.  The Apiru, having a very strong identity, were perhaps worst about this, and while they had great gratitude to Roslim, they jumped on the chance for independence as soon as it was even slightly plausible.

Roslim (Persia analogue)
> Roslim was once a small nation, tough enough to avoid destruction by its neighbors but not enough to grow an empire on its own.  However, when alchemy first moved from the hands of magicians to the hands of businessmen, it happened in Roslim, and almost overnight their focus changed.  Corporations became fabulously wealthy, riding the wave of innovation provided by alchemy, and they grew more influential as well.

> The government then saw the corporations (and equally importantly, the corresponding taxes) as their greatest strength, and set out to acquire new resources and markets.  When Baqil threatened them, they responded with new weapons, huge numbers (fueled by mercenaries), and boundless resources.  Eager for fresh territory, they quickly overwhelmed their opponents and conquered them completely.  To reduce the difficulty of occupying their new territory, they made major concessions to the conquered people (including freeing their slaves' offspring, as mentioned above, along with financial incentives, etc.) in order to quickly turn them into loyal subjects.  This worked.

> Now, the country is focused on exploration and growth into the "unclaimed" frontier to the west, and establishing colonies, industry, and trade to feed their ever-growing industrial complex.

Baqil (Babylon analogue)
> Baqil represented the most extreme excess of the old ways.  They were advanced in some ways, with more organization and education than their neighbors.  Yet their society was marked by violence and conquest.  In many ways it did not exist before it was an empire; a charismatic man attracted an army, and conquered.  As his territory grew, he grew wealthy on the spoils of war, and passed this wealth onto his descendants.  Yet the country never stabilized, and there was no national dream but more.  When the conquering grew harder, and they were faced with the complex task of ruling a country, they panicked, and picked the wrong fights.  Eventually they lost (to Roslim), and lost everything.

> Few remember the empire fondly.  Much of the old royal family was executed or otherwise died in the conflict with Roslim, and few of the old "citizens" benefited from the constant war.  Yet while Roslim uplifted their slaves of conquest, few of the Baqilites themselves benefited from the loss, and it's easy to view the new government for your new problems, even if they're the same as the old problems.  Thus, many Baqilites (who would still call themselves by that name) are poor and discontent with the government.

Javan (Greece analogue)
> Largely, Javan "comes out of nowhere," at least, from the perspective of the countries mentioned above.  Specifically, they come from across the sea, and historically have not been a major presence in the politics of this continent. The change was recent, and sudden.
 
> Their military is a fearsome force, toppling Roslim from the head, and enforcing terrible "reforms" on its conquered people.  In every way that Roslim tried to rule by consent of the ruled, Javan rules by force, including forced conversions of religion, outlawing local languages, and mass executions of cities which are expected to be difficult to hold.

> Little is known (by the characters in the game) about Javanic culture outside of conquest.  They are viewed more as locusts than people, an image they have earned and cultivated.

Notes on names:

1. I don't totally love the idea of calling it "The City," but I haven't come up with any other names that I'm happy with.
2. "Apiru" (adj. Apiru) is a transliteration of an old tribe which wandered Canaan, which is sometimes identified with the group Moses led out of Egypt (note similarity with the word "Hebrew").  So I took it as a replacement for the people name.
3. "Roslim" (adj. Roslimi), as a name, is something I made up.  It doesn't really have anything to do with the Persians, but I came up with it early and I got sort of used to the name.  I also didn't find any old words for Persia that weren't too obvious.  Also, it feels a little bit English, and I certainly used the British empire as inspiration for the day-to-day of this fictional empire.
4. "Baqil" (adj. Baqilite) is based on an old word for Babylon.  It also has some other meanings and is a somewhat common word and name in Islam and in Muslim culture, which may mean the name carries too much weight.  This name may change.
5. "Javan" (adj. Javanic) is a non-English word for Greece, which is apparently maybe still in use somewhere? And therefore may need to be changed as well.
