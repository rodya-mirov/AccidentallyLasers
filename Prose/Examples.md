To serve the theme, I have four characters in mind, representing different archetypes of people.  Some are more fleshed out than others, and perhaps different dramatic archetypes are unrealistically common in this list.  But the target audience *is* gamers, so maybe it's okay.  Basically, they're the following (excuse the lame archetype names, I came up with them kind of quickly):

1. The "zealot," who tries to fight (perceived) evil with violence.
2. The "strong," a person who is largely "just doing their job" but manages to benefit at the expense of the people around them.
3. The "avenger," who has been wronged by everyone (or maybe no one in particular) and feels justified when he lashes out.
4. The "inactive," someone who really doesn't attempt to have any impact, feeling justified by a lack of ability (or opportunity, or resources, or...)

I have specific characters in mind for each of these, of varying degrees of fleshed out (notably, a lot less detail for #4 right now, even though I think it's a very important character type, since most people will feel most in common with it).  They'll all have their own backstories, personal conflicts, etc. which will be fleshed out in detail.  But here's the birds-eye view, as pertains to the sin-justice-redemption-repentance cycle outlined in the theme document.  If some of the examples don't make sense, it's because I don't know how to present all the information in a non-circular way without saying all the "unimportant bits" first.

Here are their major failings, the things they thought were right but were wrong:

1. The zealot (Arezu) attempts to fight "evil" (as evidenced in her story by extreme corporate greed, leading to an especially brutal kind of slavery) through violence (specifically, trying to sabotage up a factory).  She ends up hurting, possibly killing, some of the people who she was originally trying to help.  Moreover the damage to the factory doesn't really hurt the owners, through a combination of their resourcefulness and her shortsightedness.
2. The strongman (Marzban) is a sort of military policeman whose job is to quell local independence through, basically, getting in the way.  He has official power to do various small things without oversight, and uses it to do his job while controlling the system in his favor, becoming a rich man.  He feels justified since he is, in fact, fulfilling his mission (stymieing local efforts at financial independence, aiding his country by holding on to a colony), though since everyone knows he is using his position selfishly, it fuels resentment  toward the capital instead of fostering dependence on it.
3. The avenger (Asif) was born into a poor farm on bad land in a poor town.  Across his life, his mother dies, the town dries up (looking for work in the city), and his father abandons him.  Eventually a bank comes to foreclose on his house due to unpaid debt, and Asif (feeling he has been wronged too many times) kills the man who comes to evict him.
4. The inactive (Joab) migrated to the City after it was safely settled and fairly stable, and pursued a humble and unassuming career.  Out of fear and perceived insufficiency of some kind, whenever conflict comes on, he avoids it as much as possible, neither making things worse nor better.  He is a non-participant in the struggle.

Here is where their failings lead directly to their respective roofs caving in:

1. Arezu faces literal criminal justice for lots of counts of destruction of property, assault, attempted murder, breaking and entering, terrorism, etc. for her actions.  Since she was caught red-handed, she faces the death penalty.
2. Marzban completely alienates the people of the City.  When his home country (Roslim) is conquered by Javan, the City comes into direct armed conflict with Javan.  Both sides view him as untrustworthy and a likely traitor, and both will kill him if he joins the other or attempts to stay neutral.
3. Asif faces simple criminal charges for murder, for which the penalty is death.
4. When the conflict arises between the City and Javan, Joab wants sanctuary in the Remnant's stronghold, and they refuse him, on account of him being unreliable and possibly disloyal.  While they do not intend to harm him in any way, this puts him in extreme danger when the invasion comes, since individual homes are not defensible.

Here is where they come to realize *that* what they did was truly wrong, typically by virtue of new information about the effect they've had:

1. Arezu's revelation comes early, when she sees the damage she caused. Not only did she not hurt the corporation she was trying to take out, but she directly hurt a lot of their victims, who were the exact people she was trying to help.
2. Marzban's revelations comes with the situation. He realizes his choice of allegiance has betrayed him (in treaty negotiations, the Roslimi leaders labeled all colonial military as "out of central control" and therefore labeled them as remaining enemy combatants), and his abuse of his power has made the City unwilling to protect him when this happens, and perhaps even makes them eager to let him die in battle.
3. Asif's revelation comes much later.  His sentence was commuted in order to make him be of service to the empire, but he still viewed his actions as defending his home.  It wasn't until a few years later, when he meets the family of the man he killed, and realized he had simply murdered an innocent man who was only guilty of carrying a letter.
4. Joab's revelation comes soon.  He realizes all the times he could have helped, not by doing *everything*, but just by doing *anything*, and eventually agrees with their logic on excluding him, since he would likely be a burden and a coward.

Then how they were given a chance to avoid justice:

1. Arezu's sentence was commuted to give her a role in rebuilding the City.  Note that she is still viewed as a prisoner, and is in custody of the military (for a while).
2. Marzban is given a promise of protection by Arezu (who is then leading the Remnant, the group which was rebelling from Roslim and now leads the defense against Javan) from reprisal from both sides, so long as he joins the fight on their side.
3. Asif's sentence was commuted to help locate and begin resettling the City.  Note that he is still viewed as a prisoner, and is under loose custody of the military.
4. Joab is taken by Asif into a support role in the farms, which are still producing food to support the Remnant.

Note that in all the above, they don't get off scot-free to go back to their old lives.  It is unconditional in that their punishment is not given to them, but conditional in that their situation is altered, and they are required to do better in the future.  To quote scripture (perhaps unfairly generalized by removal from context):  *"You are not your own, but were bought with a price.  Therefore, honor God."* (1 Cor. 6:19b-20a)

In this way, the above points are inseparable from the below, where they discover a better way to strive:

1. Arezu: during peacetime, she uses her skills to build a better world, instead of tearing down a broken one.  When violence is forced on her by a coming war, she uses her original zealotry to organize the populace and mount an organized and effective defense.
2. Marzban: he uses his old authority and military training to keep the troops in line, and to defend the City from the oncoming Javanite invasion.
3. Asif: at the beginning, he is forced into working to build the City.  But when he is redeemed, this becomes something he does willingly and even eagerly, serving others and helping to improve the lot of those around him.
4. Joab: he realizes that he can support the efforts around him, even if not in a glamorous way.  He serves the City and its defense in a background role, distributing food and other resources, as well as carrying messages and etc.  Eventually he comes to understand this is indispensible, even if it doesn't use anything special about him, for "the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few." (Matthew 9:37b)
